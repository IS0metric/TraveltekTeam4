# TraveltekTeam4

Cruise project

Ian:
- installed nautilus to be used via X11 for visual file management on the server - ports seem to be blocked
- stock photos: https://stocksnap.io/
- ideas: https://devpost.com/hackathons
- technology stack: python/flask, bootstrap (potentially)

Selling points so far:
- make it mobile-friendly

Plan:
- return all data at once to avoid delays when showing the end product. This is okay since the data that is to be transferred will be fairly small in size. This can be stored in HTML5 storage.
